This fundamentally differs from animal breeding, as it involves the manipulation of human lives and raises ethical concerns about individual autonomy, consent, and potential discrimination based on perceived genetic traits.

This might improve clarity, reduce communication barriers, and even enhance the aesthetic appeal of speech. However, the potential drawbacks include the risk of standardizing speech patterns, potentially suppressing individual accents and dialects. Its important to consider the cultural and social implications of homogenizing speech, as well as the potential for misuse in manipulating communication for persuasive purposes."
